# Booking
The booking system allows guests to book a room at the hotel for a certain period of time. When logging in, during the authorization process, the user is granted the appropriate rights: either he is a hotel employee or a visitor. The following actions are available to the hotel employee: viewing occupied rooms, editing rooms.  Users who are not employees of the hotel will be able to choose available rooms for themselves and book them for a certain period.
